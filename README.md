# Welcome to the Region of Zwarbaad

## Introduction

> "In the heart of Zwarbaad, where cobblestone streets wind through towering spires, secrets linger in every shadow. The city of Zwarbaad is your stage, and the spotlight is on you, intrepid adventurers. You already know the whispers of a city teeming with intrigue: crime organizations that thrive in the darkness, merchant families vying for power, and the enigmatic City Council that wields influence over all. The Public Order Force, standing as vigilant sentinels, enforces a semblance of peace, though they remain distinct from the city's ruling council.

> But now, the city's mood is unsettled. Your recent mission, a daring heist, has left a trail of revelations in its wake. Yian Silverstep, a figure of note among the merchant families, has been exposed as a vampire, and she fled into the night, leaving her former allies and rivals in shock. The echoes of this event reverberate throughout the city, leaving you with the promise of more questions than answers.

> As you set foot in the labyrinthine alleys of Zwarbaad, remember this: in a city where wealth and power are hoarded like precious gems, the line between savior and villain is often blurred. You find yourselves in a world where the currency of secrets is more valuable than gold, and every corner you turn holds the potential for danger or opportunity.

> Your story begins in Zwarbaad, the city where choices are made, and destinies are forged. This is a realm where noir intrigue meets high fantasy, where every character is painted in shades of gray, and every choice carries the weight of a shadowy past."
